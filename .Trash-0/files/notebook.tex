\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this project, we had to conduct data wrangling on twitter data of
`WeRateDogs'. This is a twitter account which basically rates dog images
with humorous content. The rating denominator is usually 10, however,
the numerators are usually greater than 10. This aspect was not cleaned
as it is part of the humor and popularity of WeRateDogs.

The tasks for this project were: - Data wrangling comprising of
following steps: - Gathering data - Assessing data - Cleaning data -
Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data - Creation of
report on the analyses and visualizations of the wrangled data

\hypertarget{data-wrangling}{%
\subsection{Data wrangling}\label{data-wrangling}}

\hypertarget{gather}{%
\subsubsection{1. Gather}\label{gather}}

Gathering data for this project was focused around three files. We were
provided with two files, twitter archive file containing data of 2356
tweets and second file, consisted of the image prediction data. For the
third file, we had to query the twitter API for each tweet's JSON data.
This was carried out using Python's Tweepy library and the output of
this was stored in a text file. Now, these are the three files on which
next steps, assessing and cleaning was to be carried out.

\hypertarget{assess}{%
\subsubsection{2. Assess}\label{assess}}

Assessment on the gathered data had to be done visually and
programmatically. Visual assessment of these three files helped finding
the three tidiness issues and a few of the quality issues. Programmatic
assessment helped filtering the issues.

\hypertarget{quality}{%
\subparagraph{Quality}\label{quality}}

Quality issues were detected on the basis of completeness, validity,
accuracy and consistency. Ten issues were detected based on these
parameters.

\hypertarget{tidiness}{%
\subparagraph{Tidiness}\label{tidiness}}

Tidiness revolves around structural issues. Here, we could find 3 issues
regarding to the structure.

During programmatic assessment, I checked for data types, null entries,
duplicate values, value counts etc. As for structural issues, I have
combined the data in three files and stored in to a single file. Also,
some columns were condensed into a single column and few columns were
removed.

\hypertarget{clean}{%
\subsubsection{3. Clean}\label{clean}}

This is where, all the issues found in step 2 had to be fixed. Process
for cleaning is define, code and test. Each issue was fixed with these
three steps.

\hypertarget{analysing-and-visualizing}{%
\subsection{Analysing and visualizing}\label{analysing-and-visualizing}}

The master data file was then analysed to find basic results like which
is the most favourited tweet, which is the most common dog type, what is
the most common dog name? etc. Visualization helped in summarizing these
trends over the years. The inferences are all summarized in a pdf file.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Data wrangling helped finding insights into the data which normally
would have been misleading. This was a tough yet an interesting
exercise. The issues which were solved here are only some of the issues
in the dataset. There are many issues that can help refining the data
further. I hope to carry those out in the future.
